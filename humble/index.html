        <p>Honestly I have no idea what to write here. Not the most auspicious start for a brand new blog...</p>
        <p>So why start a blog if I have nothing to say?</p>
        <p>Well, right now I am learning the basics of web development, HTML and CSS, and at this stage I don't feel I have anything to add to the conversation. I do, however, want to write some code and put into practice what I learn along the way. Hopefully, content will develop with further knowledge and experience.</p>
        <p>My main educational resources are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">MDN</a> and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a>. MDN provides excellent tutorials and documentation, while the project assignments on freeCodeCamp put that knowledge into action. </p>
        <p>I tend to move at a snail's pace - an exaggeration, I move even slower - so progress here probably won't be astronomical :)</p>
        <p><b>Update <time datetime="2020-06-17">(June 17, 2020)</time>:</b> I put the brakes on learning web development a few months ago. The resources mentioned above, however, are still valid and <em>highly recommended</em> for those with an interest in the field.</p>
