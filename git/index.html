        <h3>Getting Reacquainted With Git</h3>
        <time datetime="2020-06-22"><i class="date">June 22, 2020</i></time>
        <p>Between making my <a href="/humble">first</a> and <a href="/darkside">second</a> blog posts I forgot the basic git commands needed to update this website. While I managed to set the site up and understood the basics of a VCS (version control system) and git, I hadn’t learned the process in a way that really sunk in. We all learn differently and I tend to learn better by doing rather than purely reading documentation. So when reacquainting myself with git I thankfully found Jessica Lord’s quick tutorial app <a href="https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron">Git-it</a>.</p>
        <p>Git-it is not meant to be an all encompassing git tutorial. It is meant for people just dipping their toes in the pool. Over the course of the 11 lessons you set up git on your computer, open a GitHub account, create a repository, and learn the basics of committing, forking and merging. The lessons are helpful even if you don’t want to use GitHub for hosting.</p>
        <p>Here are the basic commands to update my simple static website.</p>
        <p>To check the website repository for any changes:</p>
        <p><code>$ git status </code></p>
        <p>To add any changed files for an update:</p>
        <p><code>$ git add 'filename'</code></p>
        <p>(To update all changed files you can use <code>$ git add -a</code>)</p>
        <p>To commit the files being updated and add a message regarding the changes:</p>
        <p><code>git commit -m “message”</code></p>
        <p>The final step of sending the updated files to the GitHub repository:</p>
        <p><code>$ git push origin master</code></p>
        <p>Two caveats to the Git-it lessons. Firstly, a few of the Git-it lessons show outdated UI on the GitHub site and so you will have to do a little problem solving to accomplish some of the tasks. This isn’t a big deal as the basic concepts are explained; it’s just that the GitHub site has been updated. Secondly, if you have enabled two factor authentication (2FA) to your GitHub account you will need to set up a token in order to push any changes from your terminal. Git-it won't warn you about this issue. See the <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line">help pages</a> for details.</p>
