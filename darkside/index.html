        <p>Like many people, I have found Zoom to be useful during the Covid-19 pandemic. Connecting with friends, doctors and other activities has been convenient - often more convenient that in “normal” times. So I felt disappointed and upset when I read about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/11/zoom-shuts-account-of-us-based-rights-group-after-tiananmen-anniversary-meeting">Zoom assisting the Chinese government in cracking down on activists remembering the Tiananmen Square massacre</a>.</p>
        <p>Troublingly, everywhere you look in the tech industry you will find this phenomenon. Apple’s devices are ubiquitous and have created “the mother of all balance sheets” according to CEO Tim Cook. Yet Apple has a host of labor issues, most well known are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_suicides">suicides</a> of two dozen workers at Foxconn City in Shenzhen, China from 2007-2016. Privacy scandals at Facebook lead to a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/24/tech/facebook-ftc-settlement/index.html">record $5 billion penalty</a> a from the Federal Trade Commission. Since 2017 Google has received $9.3 billion in fines from the European Union for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/03/20/google-fined-nearly-billion-ad-practices-that-violated-european-antitrust-laws/">antitrust violations</a>, and the US Department of Justice is expected to begin its own <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/department-of-justice-state-attorneys-general-to-sue-google-for-antitrust-violations-report/">antitrust lawsuit this summer</a>. Even while Jeff Bezos reportedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/15/amazon-jeff-bezos-gains-24bn-coronavirus-pandemic">increased his wealth by $24 billion during the Covid-19 pandemic</a> due to a 5.3% increase in Amazon stock, workers have walked out and gone on strike due to lack of worker protections from the virus.</p>
        <p>These examples are not even the tip of the iceberg. For all the technological progress of the last three decades there has been untold abuse, ecological damage, and financial inequality as a result of the progress. It would seem that this is simply part of technology. Whenever there is an innovation, what we think of as progress, there inevitably will be an abuse of that technology. This abuse is not a <em>possibility</em>, it is a <em>certainty</em>.</p>
        <p>Tech, like any technology, is a tool and a tool may be used for benefit or for harm. The fact that tech <em>will be</em> used for harm does not mean we should abolish it, but we do have to think about our involvement with it. Similarly, because tech will be abused does not mean we sit idly by and let it happen. But we can’t pretend we can find some exclusively pure and perfect implementation of technology. We must constantly try to navigate and find a balance between the benefit and harm.</p>
        <p>Upon reading the article about the Tiananmen Square massacre activists my knee jerk reaction was to delete the Zoom app immediately. My fifteen year old self would have done it. Even my thirty year old self might have done it. These days I can’t pretend to be so pure and righteous. But I will have to seek some balance to this dilemma.</p>
