        <h3>Problem solving my problem solving problems</h3>
        <time datetime="2020-07-28"><i class="date">July 28, 2020</i></time>
        <p>Recently I have revisited Harvard's <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/">CS50x</a> course and have now finally encounterd the infamous <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/3/tideman/">Tideman</a> problem. And of course I got stuck.</p>
        <p>While it is not necessary to complete Tideman, the more difficult option in Week 3's problem set, I would like to understand the course material as much as possible. The post below is simply an effort to unravel the problem(s) I was having and how best to proceed. Since these situations pop up frequently in CS50x, I figured it would be useful content to update the blog and boost my advertising hits.</p>
        <h3>What is the problem?</h3>
        <p>I am having difficulty with the Tideman problem - specifically with implementing a merge sort algorithm for the <code>sort_pairs</code> function. I created a working function, using bubble sort, but my overall goal is to understand merge sort and recursion.</p>
        <p>Going forward my options are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Continue with Tideman and see if I can complete the problem without recursive algorithms.</strong> Later on in CS50x, hopefully with a better understanding of recursion, I can return to the problem.</li>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Discussion: This would provide useful practice for the concepts I currently have some basic understanding of. I would also understand the Tideman problem better, so that when I have a grasp on merge sort and recursion I can return to Tideman andimplement those ideas more easily.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
          <li><strong>Focus on tackling recursion and specifically the example of a merge sort.</strong></li>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Discussion: This seems like it would provide little reward for a lot of effort. I have watched a few different videos explaining merge sort and I have read through some sample code of merge sort algorithms and I don't think I'm going to find anything that perfectly explains the problem to me. In fact, I actually do understand merge sort and the pseudo code! The bigger issue seems to be my understanding of C itself. I'm unsure about what inputs and outputs are required for the functions and how to access certain variables through the process. It seems like addressing this issue would be helpful.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
          <li><strong>Leave Tideman for the moment and continue with Week 4.</strong> Some aspects of the lecture and shorts - such as the call stack - may provide some insight. </li>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Discussion: This probably would not do any harm. I have completed the other problem sets necessary to move on, and it has been made abundantly clear that the lectures are mean to <em>expose</em> new ideas but not necessarily provide <em>comfort</em> with them until later on in the course. Moving on without completing Tideman, however, would feel a little incomplete. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
          <li>Give it all up and go back to drawing circles and watching Riverdale.</li>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Discussion: What the hell? We don't watch Riverdale. We watched cool nerdy shows like Rick and Morty broh.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        </ol>
        <h3>Gameplan</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Try and complete Tideman without merge sort or recursion.</li>
          <li>Take some time to understand inputs and outputs in C functions. Ask questions on Discord channel.</li>
          <li>If 1. and 2. don't lead anywhere move on to Week 4 to study the call stack.</li>
        </ol>
