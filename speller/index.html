        <h3>Speller</h3>
        <time datetime="2020-09-19"><i class="date">September 19, 2020</i></time>
        <p>Week 5 of <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/">CS50x</a> dives into data structures, focusing on linked lists, hash tables and tries. Conceptually these all made sense but I had some difficulty implementing a hash table. Someone on the class Discord channel tried to help, repeatedly banging my head against the wall with "hash tables are just an array of linked lists" - the same message the lecture and the shorts videos were trying to bang into my head.</p>
        <p>My logic was:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the hash table is pointing to something</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Make the new node point to what the hash table was pointing to</li>
            <li>Make the hash table point to the new node</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Otherwise if the hash table is pointing to nothing</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Make the hash table point to the new node</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>And the code was:</p>
        <code>
          <p>// Insert node into hash table</p>
          <p>if (table[index]->next != NULL)</p>
          <p>{</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n->next = table[index]->next;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;table[index]->next = new_node;</p>
          <p>}</p>
          <p>else</p>
          <p>{</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;table[index]->next = new_node;</p>
          <p>}</p>
        </code>
        <p>It makes sense that the person on Discord tried to clarify my understanding of a hash table. How can the program check what the hash table is pointing to if the element in the hash table is empty? No matter how much I went over the videos I still wasn't getting it.</p>
        <p>Eventually I just tried something different, just to see what would happen:</p>
        <code>
          <p>if (table[index] == NULL)</p>
          <p>{</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;table[index] = new_node;</p>
          <p>}</p>
          <p>...</p>
        </code>
        <p>The function seemed to worked in that data was being stored in the hash table, but it still wasn't completely clear until I tried to draw the process out. <em>Finally</em> I realized the <code>new_node</code> variable is merely <em>pointing</em> to the data. So assigning <code>table[index]</code> to <code>new_node</code> is merely changing where the element <em>points</em> to, not the content itself. I mistakenly thought <code>table[index] = new_node</code> would put the data inside the element <code>table[index]</code>.</p>
        <p>Oh, the joy of pointers.</p>
