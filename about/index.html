      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>I am just another <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ugly%20bag%20of%20mostly%20water">ugly bag of mostly water</a> learning about web development. In high school I enjoyed building websites and even worked on developing my school's first site. But in the 21st century I was waylaid by all sorts of adventures and distractions. I have now returned to the subject and look forward to catching up.</p>
      <p>My other technological interests include Linux, cyber security, privacy and Super Mario Bros. I also <s>like to</s> watch Manchester United.</p>
