      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>My relationship with technology feels a little conflicted. On the one hand, like many people today, I spend a lot of time in front of a screen. I use computers, smart phones and tablets for both practical purposes and for fun. Growing up I was the family member who set up, fixed, and upgraded the household computers. In high school I enjoyed building websites and even worked on developing my school's first site. At that time tech claimed the values of freedom, creativity and the intention of building a better world.</p>
      <p>The exponential growth of the tech industry over the past twenty years has exposed no small amount of warts. Lack of diversity - especially women and people of color - is a perenial problem. Living in the Bay Area I have witnessed economic inequality, gentrification and the exodus of artistic communities. And how ecologically sustainable is the growth of tech? Many of the leaders in the industry seem to have set their sights on space while ecological catastrophe continues to unravel on Earth.</p>
      <p>I am not sure how to reconcile my interest and dependence on technology with the problematic aspects of the industry. Some of the articles on this site will explore that dilemma, but hopefully most of the content will focus the various stuff I'm learning.</p>
      <p>Outside of tech I enjoy yoga, Zen, cannabis, Manchester United, Chinese cinema and walking around the Berkeley Hills.</p>
